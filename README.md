# brainfuck
My personal playground for [Brainfuck](http://en.wikipedia.org/Brainfuck) interpreters in Java. Come in different flavours.

Backed by a set of common interfaces, this Brainfuck interpreter is made to independently exchange implementations of all major components, especially

* Tape
* Instruction Set / Interpreters
* Program source

## Ideas

* Brainfuck programs preprocessed by context free / context sensitive grammars
* Brainfuck programs where tape and program source are identical
